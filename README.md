# simon-game

This project is a mini game created mostly using Javascript Jquery.
The game is inspired by the classic Simon game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), and basically is an short-memory test implying sounds and colors. 
The game is desktop only for now.
It's a fun game and an interesting project to build.
